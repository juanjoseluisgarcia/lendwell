# Lendwell Mortgage calculator

## Description
This is a simple mortgage calculator that calculates the monthly payment, total payment and total interest of a mortgage based on the loan amount, interest rate and loan term.



## Installation

After cloning the repository, run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
ng serve
```

## Technologies
- Angular 18.0.7
- Angular Material 3
This project was created with Angular 18 to show the benefits of the new features like the new input signals and the new syntax for the structural directive like `*ngFor` or `*ngIf`. 

I created unit tests to check blurred texts depending whether the component have been passed new values or not.

Mortgage calculations are completely made up, since I am not familiar with the real calculations for security reasons they shoud be run on the server. 

There are some defects in the design in the combo box. I need to look for the design tokens on the Angular Material documentation to fix it.
